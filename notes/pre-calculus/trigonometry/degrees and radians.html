            <p>So far when measuring angles (in $\theta$, pronounced thay-tuh) we only know <b>degrees</b> (marked with an $^\circ$), like $0^\circ, 45^\circ, 23^\circ$, etc.</p>
            <p>When we deal with trigonometry, we typically use degrees and another way to do angles, <b>radians</b> (marked with rad)</p>
            <p>Similar to how degrees goes from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$, radians go from $0$ to $2\pi$</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/degrees.svg">
            <img src="assets/svg/radians.svg">
            <p>As you can see in the circles above, degrees and radians correlate and represent the same fundamental idea, angles</p>
            <p>Another way to intrepret radian is 1 radian (approx $57.2958^\circ$) is the angle where the arc length of the circle is equal to the radius</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/radian explanation.svg">
            <p>In the circle above, $\theta = 1 \text{ rad}$</p>
            <p>This is also why radians are in multiples of $\pi$</p>
            <p>If you had a circle of radius $r$, then the circumference would be $2r\pi$</p>
            <p>For a circle of radius $1$, the full arc length would be the whole circle so it's full arc length is $2\pi$, so the radians of a full circle is $2\pi$</p>

            <h3>Conversions</h3>
            <p>To convert from degrees to radians: </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \text{degrees} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \text{radians}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>To convert from radians to degrees: </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \text{radians} \cdot \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \text{degrees}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>The way these formulas are derived are just from the equation of 2 ratios</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \frac{\text{radians}}{\pi} = \frac{\text{degrees}}{180^\circ}
            \end{align}$$</p>

            <h3>Why Are Radians Important?</h3>
            <p>A lot of trigonometric functions take in both degrees and radians, but radians is usaully default</p>
            <p>The reason why we use radians is because it makes the math easier</p>
            <p>Splitting the circle into 360 parts for degrees is just an arbitrary amount people set it to</p>
            <p>Radians are naturally a part of the circle (from the radius of the circle) so it can be expressed in terms of a circle</p>
            <p>Also as you will see later on in calculus, it makes representing the trigonometric functions and it's properties easier</p>

                            <p>Since a half circle is $\pi \text{ rad}$ and a quarter circle is $\pi \text{rad}$</p>
                            <p>And since $\frac{4\pi}{5}$ is in between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\pi$, we went a bit before the half-way point of the circle</p>
                            <p>This places us in the 2nd quadrant</p>
