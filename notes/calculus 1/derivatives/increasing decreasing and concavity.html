            <h3>Increasing/Decreasing Functions</h3>
            <p>We have gone over what a deriviatve is, it's slope of the tangent line, which can be interpreted as the rate of change</p>
            <p>This can relate to Increasing and Decreasing functions, but first let's define them</p>
            <p>A function $f(x)$ is Increasing on $[a,b]$ if $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$</p>
            <p>A function $f(x)$ is Decreasing on $[a,b]$ if $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ if $x_1 < x_2$</p>
            <p>What this means is that as $x$ gets bigger, does $f(x)$ get either larger (Increasing) or smaller (Decreasing)</p>
            <p>Derivatives relate to this because if a derivative is positive, that means it rate of change is positive, which means it is increasing</p>
            <p>Vice versa for negatives, this can also be formally written out</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f'(x) > 0 \text{ is Increasing} \\
                f'(x) < 0 \text{ is Decreasing} \\
                f'(x) = 0 \text{ is Constant} \\
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>Look at the graph below to visualize this</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/increasing decreasing graph.svg">
            <p>The areas where the graph is increasing has a slope or derivative that is positive</p>
            <p>The areas where the graph is decreasing has a slope or derivative that is negative</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Concavity</h3>
            <p>A function is concave up if the rate of change is increasing</p>
            <p>A function is concave down if the rate of change is decreasing</p>
            <p>Concavity can be thought as the rate of change of the rate of change, or the second derivative</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f''(x) > 0 \text{ is Concave Up} \\
                f''(x) < 0 \text{ is Concave Down} \\
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>The transition between concave up to concave down (or vice-vera) is called the inflection point</p>
            <p>The inflection point can also be thought as where $f''(x) = 0$</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/concavity graph.svg">
            <p>In the above graph, look at the various slopes of the green lines as $x$ gets larger</p>
            <p>The slope starts steep going up, then slows down, get's to a slope of 0 (flat line), then goes down</p>
            <p>This means the slopes are decreasing, meaning the the graph is concave down from negative infinity to the inflection point (at $x=\frac{1}{3}$ )</p>
            <p>This can be written as $f''(x) < 0$ where $x \in (-\infty,\frac{1}{3}]$</p>

                            <summary>Find the open intervals on which $f(x) = 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2$ is increasing or decreasing</summary>
                            <p>What we need to find is where $f'(x) > 0$ and $f'(x) < 0$</p>
                            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                                f(x) &= 3x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2 \\
                                f'(x) &= 12x^3 -48x^2 + 36x \\
                                &= 12x(x-3)(x-1)
                            \end{align}$$</p>
                            <p>The way we find the signs is to split the function into intervals where it changes from increasing to decreasing and vice versa</p>
                            <p>The way we find the split points is to use 0 because of the intermediate value theorem and find the signs of the points inside</p>
                            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                                f'(x) &= 0 \\
                                12x(x-3)(x-1) &= 0 \\
                                x &= 0, 1, 3
                            \end{align}$$</p>
                            <p>The intervals we focus on are $(-\infty, 0), (0, 1), (1,3), (3, \infty)$</p>
                            <p>These are all separated by a root wher the function has to change signs</p>
                            <p>We now check a value in each interval by plugging into $f'(x)$ and seeing the sign</p>
                            <p>We only need one point because we split it up in a way in that the whole interval is either increasing or decreasing</p>
                            <p>Here are the points I will choose to plug in</p>

                            <p>In order to find increasing/decreasing and concavity we need the first and second derivatives</p>
                            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                                f(x) &=  x^4 - 2x^3 - 12x^2 \\
                                f'(x) &= 4x^3 - 6x^2 - 24x \\
                                f''(x) &= 12x^2 - 12x - 24\\
                            \end{align}$$</p>
                            <p>The only roots of f'(x) are $x = 0, \frac{3}{4} \pm \frac{\sqrt{105}}{4}$ (approx. $-1.8117$ and $3.3117$)</p>
                            <p>This gives us the intervals $(-\infty, -1.1811), (-1.1811,0), (0,3.3117), (3.3117, \infty)$</p>
                            <p>Time to plug values that are in the intervals into $f'(x)$</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>$f'(-2) < 0$</li>
                                <li>$f'(-1) > 0$</li>
                                <li>$f'(1) < 0$</li>
                                <li>$f'(4) > 0$</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This gives the increasing intervals as $ (-1.1811,0), (3.3117, \infty)$</p>
                            <p>This gives the decreasing intervals as $ (-\infty, -1.1811), (0,3.3117)$</p>
                            <p>To find the concativity we do the same procedure, but use the split point as the points of inflection</p>
                            <p>We do this because that is where it changes the concavity</p>
                            <p>The points of inflection is the roots of $f''(x)$ which are $x = -2, 1$</p>
                            <p>This gives the concave intervals as $(-\infty, -2), (-2,1), (1,\infty)$</p>
                            <p>We plug in values that are inside the intervals into $f''(x)$ and notice the sign</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>$f''(-3) > 0$</li>
                                <li>$f''(0) < 0$</li>
                                <li>$f''(2) > 0$</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This means the function is concave up in the intervals $(-\infty, -2)$ and $(1,\infty)$</p>
                            <p>This means the function is concave down in the interval $(-2,1)$</p>
