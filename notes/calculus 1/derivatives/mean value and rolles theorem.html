            <p>Then, there is a point $c$ in $(a,b)$   ($c \in (a,b)$)</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>Or alternatively</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)
            \end{align}$$</p>

            <h3>Rolle's Theorem</h3>
            <p>If a function $f(x)$ is continous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$</p>
            <p>And, $f(a) = f(b)$, $ a \neq b$</p>
            <p>Then, there is a point $c$ in $(a,b)$   ($c \in (a,b)$)</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f'(c) = 0
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>What Do Those Theorems Mean?</h3>
            <p>If you notice in the mean value theorem output, you have the following fraction</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>This looks like the equation for a slope between two points</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>What this tells us, is that there is a point within $(a,b)$</p>
            <p>Where the tangent line of that point is parallel to the secant line of $(a, f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$</p>
            <p>Take a look at the graph</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/mean value theorem.svg">
            <p>The green point is in between the two blue points</p>
            <p>The tangent line of the green point is parallel to the secant line of the two points</p>
            <p>Since they are parallel, they share the same slope</p>
            <br>
            <p>Moving onto Rolle's Theorem</p>
            <p>What Rolle's Theorem means is that if two points with different inputs have the same output</p>
            <p>There must be an extrema or the function remains constant</p>
            <p>This can be thought intutively as if they are the same output with differnet inputs</p>
            <p>The function either stays the same, which means no rate of change so, $f'(c) = 0$</p>
            <p>Or the function changes value and returns back</p>
            <p>It could either increase or decrease, if so it has to do the opposite rate of change to move back to the original output</p>
            <p>In that change from increase to decrease or decrease to increase, there has to be a point where it stops either, so either a maxima or minima</p>
            <p>A min or max means an extrema, which means a critical point, which means $f'(c) = 0$</p>
            <p>Take a look at the graph</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/rolles theorem.svg">
            <p>Both points are on a horizontal line with same output</p>
            <p>The function starts increasing from the first point and then goes decreasing to get back to the second point</p>
            <p>The point where the function stops increasing and goes to decreasing is an extrema, the rate of change there is 0</p>
            <p>Therefore, $f'(c) = 0$</p>
            <br>
            <p>It's important to know that the Mean Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem is about the existence of the point</p>
            <p>They don't give ways to solve it, it just means you can solve it</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem</h3>
            <p>Cauchy's mean value theorem is a more generalized version of the mean value theorem</p>
            <p>If the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$</p>
            <p>Then there exists a $c \in (a,b)$ such that</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                (f(b) - f(a))g'(c) = (g(b) - g(a))f'(c)
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>This can simplified if $g(a) \neq g(b)$ and $g'(c) \neq 0$</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}
            \end{align}$$</p>

                            <p>$f(x)$ is a polynomial, so it's differentiable everywhere, therefore continous everywhere</p>
                            <p>We can use this with the Rolle's, but we need a range</p>
                            <p>We need to find a range where the only real root of $f(x)$ could be, we are going to use the Intermediate Value theorem</p>

                            <p>By The Intermediate Value Theorem/Bolzano's Theorem there is a root between $[-1,0]$</p>

                            <p>Since $c$ is between $a$ and $b$, $a$ and $b$ are real, therefore $c$ has to be real</p>
                            <p>We have to solve for $c$ and show it is not real</p>
