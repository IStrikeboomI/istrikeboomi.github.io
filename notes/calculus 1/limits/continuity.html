            <p>Imagine a function $f(x)$ is a continuous function</p>
            <p>What this means intuitively is that there are no breaks or sudden changes in its output (y value)</p>
            <p>This means that any holes and asymptotes makes the function <b>not</b> continuous</p>
            <p>Another way to think of it is if can you draw the function with a pencil without needing to lift it up, it's continous</p>
            <p>Observe the graph of $f(x) = x^2$ below</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/x^2 graph.svg">
            <p>The graph has no breaks or sudden or jumps, which continues throughout the function, meaning it is continous</p>
            <p>Now observe the graph of $f(x) = sec^{-1}(x)$</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/arccos graph.svg">
            <p>There is a sudden jump between $-1$ and $1$ showing that this is not continous</p>
            <p>A function that is <b>NOT</b> continuous is called <b>discontinuous</b></p>
            <p>For a more precise definition, a function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=c$, if and only if </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align}
                f(c) \text{ exists} \tag{1} \\
                \lim_{n \to c}{f(x)} \text{ exists} \tag{2} \\
                \lim_{n \to c}{f(x)} = f(c) \tag{3}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>Criteria (1), (2), and (3) all have to satisified</p>
            <p>If Criteria (1) and (3) are failed, then it is referd to as a <b>removable discontinuity</b> (This is what occurs with a hole)</p>
            <p>If Criteria (2) and (3) are failed, then it is referd to as a <b>non-removable discontinuity</b> or also <b>jump discontinuity</b></p>
            <p>If all criteria fail, then it is referd to as an <b>infinite discontinuity</b> if either side of the limit goes to infinity</p>

            <h3>What functions Are Continous?</h3>
            <p>A lot of common functions are continous</p>
            <p>All polynomials are continous</p>
            <p>$sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$ are continous</p>
            <p>All exponentials ($e^x$,$2^x$,$10^x$,...etc) are continous</p>
            <p>All logarithms are continous on their domains</p>
            <p>The list goes on and on</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Continous Function Properties</h3>
            <p>Using limit properties (the next note), you can see a lot of the properties can be used on continous functions</p>
            <p>For the following, assume $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are continous</p>
            <p>Sum/Difference Property: </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f(x) \pm g(x) \text{ Is Continous}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>Product Property: </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f(x) \cdot g(x) \text{ Is Continous}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>Quotient Property: </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \text{ Is Continous (if $g(x) \neq 0$)}
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>Composition: </p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                f(g(x)) \text{ Is Continous}
            \end{align}$$</p>
