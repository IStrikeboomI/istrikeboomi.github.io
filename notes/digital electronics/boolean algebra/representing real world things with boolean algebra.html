            <p>So far we have learned many boolean algebra and binary concepts, but why is what we learned important?</p>
            <p>It's because eventually we will use those principals to model, design, and build circuits</p>
            <p>But when we design circuits, we need to know how to convert between real world problems/statments</p>
            <p>This involves making variables from our input parameters (real world these can be sensors, switches, etc.)</p>
            <p>Then we need to use boolean algebra to represent the logic of the system</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Example 1: Simple Security System</h3>
            <p>Imagine we want to design a simple security system for a house</p>
            <p>The security system is an alarm that goes off (output) when it is not daytime and motion is detected</p>
            <p>We can represent daytime as a boolean variable `D` (true if daytime, false if night)</p>
            <p>We can represent motion detected as a boolean variable `M` (true if motion detected, false if no motion)</p>
            <p>Now we can create a boolean expression for when the alarm should go off</p>
            <p>$A = D' \cdot M$</p>
            <p>We will show later how to convert this into a <a href="../digital circuits/digital circuits and logic gates.html">digital circuit</a></p>

            <h3>Example 2: Fan Temperature Cooling System</h3>
            <p>Imagine a fan that turns on when it is manually turn on or temperature is too high and it has been 30 seconds </p>
            <p>Manual switch is $S$, temperature too hot is $T$, and time past 30s is $P$</p>
            <p>$F = S + TP$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Example 3: Cat Cafe</h3>
            <p>Imagine a cat cafe that has a spot for people to go in</p>
            <p>There are 2 cats that come in controlled by electronic doors</p>
            <p>The cats hate each other, but they like people</p>
            <p>The people are happy when the cats are happy, AKA not fighting (so only 1 cat at a time)</p>
            <p>Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the boolean variables for cat 1 and cat 2 being in the cafe</p>
            <p>$H = C_1'C_2 + C_2'C1 = C_1 \oplus C_2$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Convert into a sentence</h3>
            <p>Let's say we have the boolean expression:</p>
            <p>$$G = C'(S + A + W)$$</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$G$ means the grass is green</li>
                <li>$C$ means it is cold</li>
                <li>$S$ means it is summer</li>
                <li>$A$ means it is spring</li>
                <li>$W$ means the grass has been watered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So the sentence is:</p>
            <p>The grass is green when it is not cold and it is either summer, spring, or the grass has been watered.</p>
