            <p>When storing data that is multiply bytes in memory, you have a choice of how to order the bytes</p>
            <p>The order in which bytes are stored in memory is called endianness.</p>
            <p>In <b>big endian</b>, the <a href="number bases.html">most significant byte</a> is stored first (at lowest memory address).</p>
            <p>In <b>little endian</b>, the least significant byte is stored first (at lowest memory address).</p>
            <p>Each indivual byte however is stored using big endian (MSB comes first within each byte)</p>
            <p>Big endian used in our normal base-10/decimal system</p>
            <p>On modern computers, most use little endian for storing <a href="binary data.html">binary data</a></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Let's say we have the hexadecimal number 0x12345678 (4 bytes)</p>
            <p>In big endian, it would be stored in memory as:</p>
            <p>Address: 0x00 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03</p>
            <p>Value: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  0x12 | 0x34 | 0x56 | 0x78</p>
            <p>In little endian, it would be stored in memory as:</p>
            <p>Address: 0x00 | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03</p>
            <p>Value: &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x78 | 0x56 | 0x34 | 0x12</p>
            <p>You might notice that in little endian, the bytes are reversed compared to big endian.</p>
            <p>You might also have noticed we have only done big endian numbers so far</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Converting Between Endian Formats</h3>
            <p>To convert between big endian and little endian, you simply reverse the order of the bytes.</p>
            <p>Don't forget in hex, 1 byte is 2 hexadecimal digits (00-FF)</p>
            <p>For example, to convert the big endian number 0x12345678 to little endian</p>
            <p>You would reverse the order of the bytes to get 0x78563412.</p>
            <p>To convert the little endian number 0x78563412 to big endian</p>
            <p>You would reverse the order of the bytes to get 0x12345678.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Why Endianness Matters</h3>
            <p>Endianness matters when interpreting binary data</p>
            <p>If you read multi-byte data with the wrong endianness, you'll get incorrect values.</p>
            <p>Since we have done everything so far in big endian</p>
            <p>You have to convert from little to big endian to do arithmetic properly.</p>

                            <p>First, split the binary into bytes: 0b11100011 01010101</p>
                            <p>Then, reverse the order of the bytes: 0b01010101 11100011</p>
                            <p>So, the Little Endian representation is 0b0101010111100011</p>
