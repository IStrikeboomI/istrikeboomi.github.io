            <p>This note will be building upon the previous introducing more circuit laws and terminology</p>
            <p>The first main law we have established is Ohm's Law $V = IR$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Circuit Terminology</h3>
            <p>Take a look at this "complex" circuit</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit.svg">
            <p>We can't use ohm's law directly here because there are multiple resistors and voltage sources</p>
            <p>We can break this circuit down into smaller parts using <b>Nodes, Loops, and Meshes</b></p>
            <p>A <b>Node</b> is any point in the circuit where two or more components connect</p>
            <p>Think of it as the number of independent shorts/wires in the circuits</p>
            <p>A <b>Loop</b> is any closed path in the circuit (only consider components on the outside)</p>
            <p>A <b>Mesh</b> is a loop that does not contain any other loops inside of it</p>
            <p>There is a formula for Meshes, $\text{Meshes} = \text{Components} - \text{Nodes} + 1$</p>
            <p>If we count the amount of nodes, loops and meshes in the above circuit</p>
            <p>We get 5 nodes, 6 loops, and 3 meshes</p>
            <p>We get 5 nodes because there are 5 independent shorts (boxed in blue)</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit nodes.svg">
            <p>There are 6 loops</p>
            <ol>
                <li>$V_{in1}$ to $R_4$ to $R_1$</li>
                <li>$R_1$ to $R_2$ to $R_5$</li>
                <li>$V_{in2}$ to $R_3$ to $R_2$</li>
                <li>$V_{in1}$ to $R_4$ to $R_2$ to $R_5$</li>
                <li>$V_{in2}$ to $R_3$ to $R_5$ to $R_1$</li>
                <li>$V_{in1}$ to $R_4$ to $V_{in2}$ to $R_3$ to $R_5$</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit loops.svg">
            <p>This is cluttered so we can split this into the 3 smaller loops, 2 medium loops, and the other loop</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit small loop.svg">
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit medium loop.svg">
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit big loop.svg">
            <p>Finally we have 3 meshes</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/complex circuit meshes.svg">
            <p>You might notice the 3 smaller loops are the meshes</p>
            <p>We can also use the formula above for meshes (there are 5 resistors and 2 voltage sources so 7 components)</p>
            <p>So $3 = 7 - 5 + 1$ which is correct</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Polarity and Positive/Negative Voltage and Current</h3>
            <p>When analyzing circuits its important to keep track of voltage and current directions</p>
            <p>By convention voltage sources have a positive and negative terminal (called the polarity)</p>
            <p>Current is considered to flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a voltage source</p>
            <p>For a resistor the positive side is the terminal where current enters, negative where current leaves</p>

            <p>This is called <b>Conventional Current Flow</b></p>
            <p>When current flows through a resistor there is a voltage drop across the resistor</p>
            <p>This means the terminal where current enters the resistor is at a higher voltage </p>
            <p>Than the terminal where current leaves the resistor</p>
            <p>This is why to find the voltage across a resistor, you need to do the difference of each side</p>
            <p>$$V_R = V_{in} - V_{out}$$ $V_{in}$ is the voltage at the terminal where current enters</p>
            <p>$V_{out}$ is the voltage at the terminal where current leaves</p>
            <br>
            <p>If current flows in the opposite direction of what you assumed, the current will be negative</p>
            <p>If voltage is measured in the opposite direction of what you assumed, the voltage will be negative</p>
            <p>This just means that negative current and voltage is backwards (this is fine)</p>
            <p>Here is a diagram showing resistor polarity and how it relates to current and voltage</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/resistor polarity.svg">
            <p>Note that resistors don't inheritly have polarity</p>
            <p>The location of the plus and minus signs depend on the current</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>KCL and KVL</h3>
            <p>The next 2 extremely important laws for circuits are <b>KCL</b> and <b>KVL</b></p>
            <p><b>KCL</b> or <b>Kirichoff's Current Law</b> says the sum of the currents entering and leaving a <b>node</b> is 0</p>
            <p>In other words the currents entering a node equal the currents leaving a node</p>
            <P>Expressed Mathematically:</P>
            <p>$$\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$$ or $$\sum I = 0$$</p>
            <p>This is because charge cannot build up at a node</p>
            <p>Here is a digram to represent it</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/kcl.svg">
            <p>The currents entering are $I_1,I_2,I_3$ and the currents leaving are $-I_4,-I_5$ (negative because they are leaving)</p>
            <p>$$I_1 + I_2 + I_3 - I_4 - I_5 = 0 \text{ or } I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = I_4 + I_5$$ </p>
            <p><b>KVL</b> or <b>Kirchhoff's Voltage Law</b> says the sum of the voltages around any <b>closed loop</b> is 0</p>
            <p>In other words the sum of voltage rises equal the sum of voltage drops around a loop</p>
            <P>Expressed Mathematically:</P>
            <p>$$\sum V_{rise} = \sum V_{drop}$$ or $$\sum V = 0$$</p>
            <p>This is because energy cannot be created or destroyed in a closed loop</p>
            <p>Heres an example diagram</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/kvl.svg">
            <p>This circuit has 3 loops so we can make 3 KVL equations ($V_{R_1}$ and $V_{R_2}$ are the voltages across $R_1$ and $R_2$)</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align}
                V_{in1} + V_{R_1} + V_{R_2} &= 0 \\
                V_{in2} + V_{R_1} &= 0 \\
                V_{in1} + V_{in2} + V_{R_2} &= 0
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>We can also make the KCL equations for the 3 nodes (use Ohm's law $I = V/R$ for current across resistors)</p>
            <p>These 2 laws are extremely important for analyzing circuits</p>
            <p>Later on we will assign values to the voltage source and resistors and solve for currents/voltages</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align}
                I_{V_{in1}} + \frac{V_{R_1}}{R_1} + I_{V_{in2}} &= 0 \\
                I_{V_{in2}} + \frac{V_{R_1}}{R_1}  + \frac{V_{R_2}}{R_2} &= 0 \\
                I_{V_{in1}} + \frac{V_{R_2}}{R_2} &= 0
            \end{align}$$</p>

            <h3>Series And Parallel Circuits</h3>
            <p>There are a few ways to connect components in a circuit, <b>Series</b>, <b>Parallel</b>, or neither</p>
            <p>Components have to have 2 ends (a positive and negative) so they can make a closed circuit</p>
            
            <p>Components are in <b>Series</b> if they solely share a node (no other component connected to that node)</p>
            <p>Components are in <b>Parallel</b> if they share both nodes (connected to the same two nodes)</p>
            <p>Knowing if components are in series or parallel is important for analyzing circuits</p>
            <p>This is because we can (depending on the component) combine components using some formula</p>
            <p>You can also be in series or parallel with shorts by treating them as $0$ ohm resistors</p>
            <p>Being in series with a short doesn't mean much but being in parallel with a short is important</p>
            <p>Find which components are in series or parallel in the following circuits</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/parallel series circuit.svg">
            <p>First for series components</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$R_5$ and $R_6$ are in series</li>
                <li>$R_6$ and $V_{in1}$ are in series</li>
                <li>$V_{in1}$ and $R_1$ are in series</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next for parallel components</p>
            <ul>
                <li>$R_2$, $R_3$, $R_4$, are in parallel</li>
                <li>$R_7$ and the short it is on are in parallel</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Heres the same circuit above labeled (blue rectangles show series and red rectangles show parallel)</p>
            <img src="assets/svg/parallel series circuit labeled.svg">
            <p>One reason why we care about series and parallel circuits is using KCL and KVL we can show the following</p>
            <p><b>Voltage</b> is the same across components in <b>parallel</b></p>
            <p><b>Current</b> is the same across components in <b>series</b></p>
            <p>This is extremely important and makes it easier to analyze circuits</p>
