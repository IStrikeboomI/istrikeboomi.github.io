            <p>We discussed resistors earlier in the context of circuits as providing resistance to current</p>
            <p>Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω), the higher the resistance the less current it can provide</p>
            <p>This is given by Ohm's law $V=IR$</p>
            <p>Now resistors are a useful component because they give a known value</p>
            <p>But truth is any matter can be used a resistor, because resistance is a property of matter</p>
            <p>The way resistors dissipate energy is through <b>heat</b></p>
            <P>The higher the voltage, the higher current it's disspating so the hotter it gets</P>
            <p>We can also combine resistance in series or parallel</p>
            <p>To combine 2 resistors in series: $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$</p>
            <p>To combine 2 resistors in parallel: $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$</p>
            <p>To generalize to $n$ resistors</p>
            <p>Series:</p>
            <p>$$R_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n R_i = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n$$</p>
            <P>Parallel</P>
            <p>$$\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{R_i} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}$$</p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p>$$R_{total} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{R_i} \right)^{-1} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n} \right)^{-1} $$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Resistivity</h3>
            <p>Resistivity is a property of matter that indicates how much resistance it provides</p>
            <p>Resistivity is measured in ohm meters ($\Omega \cdot m$) and typically denoted with rho $\rho$</p>
            <p>Reistance depends on resitivity, length, and also temperature of the material</p>
            <p>The resistance of a material is given by the formula</p>
            <p>$$R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$$</p>
            <p>Where $L$ is the length of the material and $A$ is the cross sectional area</p>
            <p>This means that the longer the material, the higher the resistance</p>
            <p>And the thicker the material, the lower the resistance</p>
            <p>We typically don't worry about resitivity, but with resistance</p>
            <P>Since resistivity is a property of matter, everything has resistance</P>
            <p>This includes the human body, which has a resistance value that can varies a lot</p>
            <p>Typically its between $100k \Omega$ and $1M \Omega$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Types of Resistors</h3>
            <p>There are many types of resistors, the most common being fixed and variable resistors</p>
            <p>Fixed resistors have a set resistance value, while variable resistors can change their resistance</p>
            <p>Variable resistors are also called potentiometers or rheostats</p>
            <p>Resistor (the component) are typically cylinder shaped</p>
            <p>They also might have 4 or 5 color bands the indicate their resistance value</p>
            <p>Here are some color code charts</p>
            <a href="https://static4.arrow.com/-/media/arrow/images/miscellaneous/1123-chart-how-to-read-resistor-color-codes-body-image.jpg">Chart 1</a>
            <a href="https://res.utmel.com/Images/UEditor/c1290dff-919c-4c71-b9f2-aa57a8eef5f6.png">Chart 2</a>
            <p>Resistors can vary between 10 $\Omega$ and 10 M$\Omega$, or even higher</p>
            <p>You might notice the last band means tolerance or error</p>
            <p>This is because manufacturing is not perfect so there is some variance</p>
            <p>Typical resistors also have a max voltage/power they can handle before they get too hurt and burn</p>
            <p>There are also other kinds of resistors like SMD resistors which are surface mounted</p>

            <h3>Resistor Color Code Example</h3>
            <p>Look at the following picture of a resistor</p>
            <img width="400" src="assets/images/10k resistor.jpg">
            <p>We start at the leftmost band and move right<p>
            <p>We know the leftmost is where the bands are grouped together tighter</p>
            <p>It also opposite the side of the metallic colored band (always the tolerance)</p>
            <p>The bands are brown, black, black, red, gold</p>
            <p>I know the image looks hard to see, but it's easier to see in person</p>
            <p>If there were 4 bands instead of 5 you would ignore the third digit place</p>
            <p>brown first digit means 1</p>
            <p>black second digit means 0</p>
            <p>black third digit means 0</p>
            <p>red multiplier means $10^2$</p>
            <p>gold tolerance means 5%</p>
            <p>Putting this all together</p>
            <p>$$\begin{align} 
                100 \times 10^2 &= 10000 \Omega \\
                &= 10 k\Omega \pm 5 \% \\
            \end{align}$$</p>
            <p>The $10k\Omega$ is called the nominal value and the $\pm 5 \%$ is called the tolerance</p>
            <p>The $\pm 5 \%$ means the actual resistance can vary by 5 percent above or below the nominal value</p>
            <p>This means the value can range between $9.5 k\Omega$ and $10.5 k\Omega$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Conductance</h3>
            <P>If resistance is the opposition to current</P>
            <p>Then conductance (in Siemens $\Omega^{-1}$or Mho $\mho$)is the reciprocal of resistance</p>
            <p>For example if a resistor has resistance of $50 \Omega$</p>
            <p>Then it has a conductance of $\frac{1}{50} \text{ or } .02 \Omega^{-1}$</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Resistors In Circuits</h3>
            <p>The symbol for a resistor is a squiggly line</p>
            <P>A rectangle is also used for some resistive load (any matter), but not a resistor</P>

                            <p>The $15 \Omega$ resistor isn't connected on both ends so it's not part of the circuit</p>
                            <p>You can think of the open circuit as an $\infty \Omega$ resistor in series </p>
                            <p>so combining it with the $15 \Omega$ also makes it $\infty \Omega$ (another open circuit)</p>
                            <p>This means we can just get rid of it</p>

                            <p>So our resistance is $10 \Omega$</p>
